# Exam Preparation

* *If you donâ€™t have any experience with AWS service, I will recommend first start with acloudguru.com. Please donâ€™t miss **AWS â€” 10,000 Foot Overview,** this will give you a good overview of all the AWS Services.*

<!--StartFragment-->

* *The second, one of the most useful resource is Linux Academy. One of the advantages of using Linux Academy is its hands-on lab. This will give you enough handâ€™s on experience required for the certification.*


* ***AWS Re: Invent Videos:** I highly recommend going through these videos, as they will give you enough in-depth knowledge about each service.*
* ***AWS Documentation:** Best documentation ever provided by any service provider. Donâ€™t miss the FAQ regarding each service(especially for EC2, S3, VPC)*
* Exam Readiness
* *Last but not the least, hands-on experience, there is no substitute for that. As per certification pre-requisite*

## Services

*You must know these three services in order to clear this EXAM*

* *EC2*
* *VPC*
* *S3*

*Some services which I under-estimate and I saw at least 2â€“4 question related to those services*

* *DynamoDB*
* *Kinesis Firehouse*
* *CloudFront*
* *SQS*

*I am not using any of these services in my day to day operation, and thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t pay much attention. Also, itâ€™s time for AcloudGuru and Linux Academy to add some more in-depth content related to these services*

***Some surprise packages***

* *AWS Athena*
* *AWS Inspector*

***My Idea about the exam***

* *As this is an associate level exam, my initial perception about this exam that I donâ€™t need to go in-depth of all of the services but this exam surprises me with some in-depth questions. So please make sure to read/implement as much as possible about (EC2/VPC/S3).*

## Letâ€™s talk about different Services and what concept you should know in order to clear this exam

## S3

* *This table is the key to understand different S3 storage classes. Make sure you understand*

[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/instance-store-vs-ebs/)

* ***Security Group**(They are not going to ask you this question directly but mostly scenario based questions like multi-tier environment where you have web frontend vs MySQL as database and which port you are going to open in your backend DB(MySQL), As you only need a connection from the web frontend, you only need to specify Mysql DB security group)*

## LoadBalancer

* *Difference between Application vs Network Load Balancer and in which scenario you are going to use which one*

## [Elastic Load Balancing Features](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/)

### [Elastic Load Balancing provides integrated certificate management and SSL/TLS decryption, allowing you the flexibilityâ€¦](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/)

[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/)

# VPC

* *Create VPC from scratch(At least 2 Private Subnet and 2 public Subnet)*
* *What is the use of Internet Gateway and what changes you need to make in your routing table to route the traffic to the internet(0.0.0.0/0 to IGW)*
* *How Private Instance is going to talk to the Internet(NAT Gateway)(again create it from scratch)*
* *VPC Endpoints(understand the difference between Gateway Endpoint vs Interface Endpoint)*
* *Difference between NACL vs Security Group*

## CloudWatch

* *Remember Cloudwatch now is not only to display metrics but you can also push application logs via Cloudwatch agents*


## [What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs? â€” Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)

### [Describes the fundamentals, concepts, and terminology you need to know for using CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, andâ€¦](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)

## [Placement Groups â€” Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)

### [Launch instances in a placement group to cluster them logically into a low-latency group, or to spread them acrossâ€¦](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)

[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)

## [Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) â€” Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html)

### [Use Amazon EFS to create an EFS file system and mount it to one or more of your Linux instances.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html)

[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html)

* ***Lambda:** Whenever they talk about cost optimization then lambda is your go-to choice(But please read the scenario carefully)*

# Route53

* *Understand the difference between different routing policy*

## [Choosing a Routing Policy â€” Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html)

### [Choose a routing policy before you create records in Amazon Route 53.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html)

[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html)

* *Pay special emphasis to a latency based(key word user in specific region facing latency, so key choice is between Route53 vs CloudFront)and failover routing policy*

***Autoscaling:** Just a brief idea about how auto-scaling works*

# Databases

* *For RDS MySQL understand the difference between read-only replication(performance gain) vs HA(in case of failover)*
* *AWS is paying special emphasis on Aurora, so in case if they ask migrating on-premises MySql/Postgres to AWS Cloud then Aurora is the best bet*

***IAM***

* *Make sure you understand the purpose of roles and use roles to communicate to different AWS Service, rather than using Public Internet Route*
